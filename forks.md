# TensorFlow Tutorials - Forks

These are forks of the [original TensorFlow Tutorials by Hvass-Labs](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials).
They are not developed or even reviewed by the original author, who takes no reponsibility for these forks.

If you have made a fork of the TensorFlow Tutorials with substantial modifications that you feel may be useful to others,
then please [open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/issues) with a link and short description.
